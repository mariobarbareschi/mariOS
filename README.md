# mariOS
mariOS Answers the Request for an Implementation of an OS.
The project implements a very easy and tiny core by supporing tasks creation, round-robin time-sharing scheduling, preemption and explicit task yield.
Actually, it supports exclusively the ARM Cortex M4 through the definition of two interrupt handlers.
Take the project as it is: easy to comprehend, small, ready-for-compiling over a STM32 toolchain (even though easily portable over others toolchains), ready for future extensions.
